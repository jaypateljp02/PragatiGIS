Analysis Complete! Here's what I found:
Functions & Components Not in Use (Can be removed):
Duplicate Pages that overlap existing functionality:
OCRReviewPage.tsx - This duplicates OCR review features already built into DocumentWorkflowPage.tsx
UploadPage.tsx - Simple wrapper that just shows the DocumentUpload component already used elsewhere
WorkflowPage.tsx - Overlaps heavily with DocumentWorkflowPage functionality
Duplicate Functions:
ThemeToggle function appears in both App.tsx and LoginPage.tsx - can be moved to a shared component
Pages That Can Be Merged:
Main consolidation opportunity: Combine document workflow pages
Merge DocumentWorkflowPage + OCRReviewPage + UploadPage + WorkflowPage
DocumentWorkflowPage already handles most functionality
OCR review is already integrated as tabs
Upload functionality is already there
Workflow orchestration is already present
Consider merging reporting pages:
ReportsPage and parts of DSSPage have overlapping analytics features
Backend Redundancy:
Duplicate Flask backends:
flask-backend/ directory (appears unused)
flask_backend/ directory (appears unused)
Currently using Express.js backend - Flask backends can be removed
Duplicate Schema files:
shared/schema.ts (PostgreSQL version - unused)
shared/schema-sqlite.ts (Currently used SQLite version)
What I'll do to simplify:
Remove unused pages (3 files): OCRReviewPage.tsx, UploadPage.tsx, WorkflowPage.tsx
Remove duplicate backends (2 directories): flask-backend/, flask_backend/
Remove unused schema (1 file): shared/schema.ts
Create shared ThemeToggle component instead of duplicating
Update routing to remove references to deleted pages
This will reduce your codebase by 7 files/directories and make the application much simpler to maintain. The main workflow will be handled entirely through DocumentWorkflowPage.tsx which already has all the necessary functionality.
Should I proceed with these cleanup changes?
Plan to simplify the code
Analyzed codebase for simplification (4 seconds)
3 minutes of work
ok
and i wanto make merge claims management and document flow as has same functions make it togther
in seeting remove system in security remove 2 factor remove notigication
change avatar not working
in report remove recent report and live analytics
